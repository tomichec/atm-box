# bleskomat-box
The Bleskomat's case design and development process will be here.

## Development process

The basic design is generated using boxes.py python package [1] available also through the website interface [2].

[1] https://github.com/florianfesti/boxes/
[2] https://festi.info/boxes.py/

The box we use is called "Console2". The list of plain designs links can be found below.

After the design had been rendered and saved to a computer in the SVG format we further edit it with inkscape.

Different colors of the lines can have different meaning for the laser cutter, e.g. black for the cut, blue for the engraving.

The design has to be placed on a sheet with the size of the ply wood that we use (Make sure that the fortmat is under the maximal size of the laser cutter of the workshop you are going to manufacture it in).

The file `parts.svg` contains a library of the additional holes for devices used in bleskomat. Place the holes on the rendered design in the correct possition and group them with the underlaying units for an easy manipulation. Then move or copy all required parts in the file of the correct size of the ply wood.

Finally, convert the file and save it with the correct version number. The workshops often prefer the design in DXF of PDF file.
